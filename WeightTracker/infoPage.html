            This website was very exciting to build. It has a password with a keypad for entry
            and has a menu that has three buttons linking to a sign up page, weight-entry,
            and a progress. This is intended to help track your progress toward a desired
            goal weight. The Sign Up collects data on the user and all fields should be 
            entered before starting to input weight entries. Next the weight-entry is for 
            the user to established there current weight, the day of that weight, the goal,
            and Calories used that day. While the idea is to have the user input their info 
            on each day I needed to allow the user to input multiple dates to have multiple
            data points to show progress. Although a user may forget a day to track and can 
            add it on this page. The progress page requires data to be used and hold a 
            welcome message, a progress chart, and a table with the data entries. It 
            also contains the first entry for a starting weight as well as the last weight 
            being the current one. Goals should stay consistent however may be changed
            throughout. I hope this application helps you reach your goals in reaching and
            maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
